# SoccerML for CSE 368 

This project intends to predict the (#) of goals of a given striker within a dataset containing statistics on soccer players in the 2023-24 premier league. We plan to use a regression model from the scikit-learn python library, along with data manipulation and storage libraries such as pandas and numpy.
